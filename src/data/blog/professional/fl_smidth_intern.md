### From Design to Reality: My Internship at FLSmidth  

During my 2019 winter break from college, I took on a full-time unpaid internship at FLSmidth, a mining design and manufacturing company. It was an intense, hands-on experience that gave me a deep dive into both the **manufacturing** and **design engineering** sides of the industry.  

#### Learning the Manufacturing Process  

In the manufacturing department, I shadowed engineers who walked me through the **Discriminator CNC Editor**, showing me how they transformed digital designs into real, functional parts. To see the full process in action, I also worked alongside a machinist, gaining hands-on experience with the execution of manufacturing plans. This firsthand exposure taught me valuable lessons about designing with **manufacturability in mind**—a perspective that engineers often overlook until they see the production side up close.  

#### Rapid-Fire Design Engineering  

After my time in manufacturing, I spent a week with FLSmidth's design engineering team. My introduction to **SolidWorks** was more of a trial by fire than a formal training session—I was handed the software and left to figure it out on my own. Within days, I picked it up quickly and cranked out over **30 advanced assemblies and parts** for the company's new eCommerce platform in just five days.  

Beyond the hours spent at the computer, I also worked with design engineers in the lab, reverse-engineering **ball bearings, pinion shaft spacers, and even a massive undercarriage drive roller**. Breaking down real-world mechanical components and recreating them in CAD was a challenge, but it reinforced my understanding of engineering principles in a way that textbooks never could.  

#### Real-World Lessons  

This internship was more than just an opportunity to build my technical skills—it was a **bridge between theory and industry**. I walked away with a stronger grasp of **designing for manufacturing, problem-solving under pressure, and quickly adapting to new tools and workflows**. More importantly, I got to see how engineering ideas turn into real, working systems—a lesson that continues to shape how I approach technical challenges today.

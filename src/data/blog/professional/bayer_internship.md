### A Summer in the Cornfields: My Unexpected Internship  

There’s something I never thought would come out of my mouth.  

Growing up in a small town in central Illinois, cornfields were everywhere. When giving directions to someone from another town, I’d say, "Take a left at the cornfield and a right at the next cornfield." Occasionally, a soybean field would pop up along the way, making navigation just a tad bit easier. Yes, I know what you’re thinking—navigating by corn is about as successful as using the sky as a map. It’s not easy at all.  

Life in a town with a population under 2,000 is as flat and unremarkable as the Great Plains it sits upon.  

#### An Unexpected Call  

It was the summer after my first year of college, and after my endless stream of internship applications fell flat, I got a call. It was Bayer. Yes, that Bayer. Like the one that makes medicine.

They wanted me to help inspect fields. Specifically, I’d be conducting check-ups on hybridized cornfields worth tens of millions of dollars. With no other plans and a hunger for hard work, I jumped at the chance and started the next day after moving back home from school.  

#### A Glimpse into Agricultural Engineering  

Due to various contracts and NDAs, I can't dive into specifics about what I worked on, but trust me when I say it was amazing. The amount of **science, engineering, and technology** involved in the production of hybrid seed corn is astonishing.  

Not only did I get to lead a group of five coworkers, but I also gained hands-on experience as an agricultural engineer. I solved problems every day—like the time my car got stuck in the middle of a cornfield. Or the time I lost both my personal and work phones in the vast cornfield (pro tip: finding a phone on silent in the middle of a cornfield is *way* harder than finding a needle in a haystack).  

#### Lessons from the Fields  

Sometimes, the most valuable lessons come from the most unexpected places. I never imagined I’d work in agriculture, but that summer, it became one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. For that, I’m thankful.

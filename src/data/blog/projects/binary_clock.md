description: That time I learned to weld.
---

Finally, I thought, I can make something with some real-world tools. That was my reaction to being assigned a clock welding project.

For the project in typical 'Tanner J. Style,' I wanted to challenge the process by making a truly unique clock. I thought of using binary code to represent the hours on the clock. By punching a hole in a steel plate, you get a '1,' and the absence of a hole represents a '0.'

Combine this unique numbering system with measurements consistently found in the powers of two, and you get this super aesthetic clock.

This project showcases my newly-found skill of TIG/GTAW welding, and yes, I am aware those welds are far from perfect! In addition, I used elements of design, teamwork, and various shop tools to oversee the production and completion of our clock.

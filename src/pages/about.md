Iâ€™m a Technical Editor with a background in engineering and a passion for automation, emerging technologies, and solving complex problems. I specialize in technical writing and editing with a focus on automation, transforming traditional workflows by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Python scripting, and Docs-as-Code methodologies. Want proof? Check [this](https://github.com/tannerjallen) out.

## What I Do

Iâ€™m currently a Senior Technical Editor at Tesla, where I support new product launches and firmware updates across Teslaâ€™s vehicle lineupâ€”including some of the most innovative and best-selling vehicles in the world. My work includes:

- Writing to vehicle firmware and leading the creation of Theory of Operation documents for each vehicle model.
- Composing user and service-facing messages that appear in millions of vehicles and Teslaâ€™s diagnostic tools.
- Owning diagnostic content top to bottom for several vehicle subsystems.
- Automating technical editing tasks using Python, Vale style linter, and LLMs.
- Maintaining Docs-as-Code workflows and contributing to frontend updates for an in-house web application used to diagnose hundreds of thousands of vehicles.

## Background & Expertise

I started my career as an engineer, working for the Illinois Department of Transportation and later on the [$1.2 billion Regional Connector project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Connector) in downtown Los Angeles. Those experiences taught me the importance of becoming a subject matter expertâ€”a skill that naturally led me to technical editing and writing.

Since joining Tesla, Iâ€™ve worked on every major product launch, including:  
âœ… 2021+ Model S  
âœ… 2021+ Model X  
âœ… Semi  
âœ… Cybertruck  
âœ… 2024+ Model 3  
âœ… 2025+ Model Y  
â€¦and some exciting upcoming projects (ðŸ˜‰).

Along the way, Iâ€™ve learned from plenty of challengesâ€”including the time I told a construction crew to tear down the wrong wall (lesson learned!).

## Skills & Technologies

I put the **technical** in **technical editing**, combining my engineering mindset with automation and modern documentation tools. My expertise includes:

- Docs-as-Code workflows (Markdown, GitHub, single-sourcing content)
- Python scripting to automate tedious or impossible manual tasksâ€”like exporting a 1,200+ page manual in under a week!
- [Vale style linter](https://vale.sh/) & LLMs for content editing
- DITA XML & Oxygen XML Editor
- New product introduction project management

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, Iâ€™m constantly learning and building things. I have a deep interest in electronics, vintage technology restoration (currently restoring a 1950s record player), and engineering projectsâ€”whether itâ€™s building a laser-cutting cardboard CNC machine or developing an AI-powered dog detection system with Raspberry Pi.

Iâ€™m also a _very_ average runner (at what point are you supposed to like running?). I completed a marathon and currently maintain half-marathon fitness with the hope it might save me in an apocalypse though I'm not convinced it will. When Iâ€™m not working on my latest tech project or out on a run, you might find me at the driving range, working to improve my golf game.
